# Multi-stage Docker build for Product Order Service
# 
# Design Principles Applied:
# - Multi-stage Build: Reduces final image size
# - Security: Uses non-root user
# - Performance: Optimized for Java applications
# - Maintainability: Clear and documented Dockerfile

# Build stage
FROM maven:3.9.5-openjdk-17-slim AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml first for better layer caching
COPY pom.xml .

# Download dependencies
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code
COPY src ./src

# Build application
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Runtime stage
FROM openjdk:17-jre-slim

# Install necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy JAR file from build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Change ownership to non-root user
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1

# Run application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
